\title{Class for a hullsets}
\description{
Class for a collection of hullsets and associated objects
including hull metrics and isopleths
}
\details{
An object of class \code{locoh.lhs} is a list (S3)
containing one or more sets of hulls (local MCPs) for a set
of points. One hull is saved for each point if the method
used to create the hulls returned at least two nearest
neighbors for each point, otherwise the number of hulls
might be less than the number of points. In addition to
hulls (saved as a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame), LoCoH-hullset
object may also contain:

\itemize{ \item the original points and their attribute
table \item an index of the points a) used to construct the
hull and b) enclosed by each hull \item hull metrics \item
isopleths (progressive unions of hulls) as both vector
(SpatialPolygonsDataFrame) and raster (utilzation
distribution) formats.  \item saved parameters for
scatterplots of hull metrics.  }

In code examples, objects of class \code{locoh.lhs} are
often noted by a 'lhs' suffix, and functions that are
designed to work on LoCoH-hullset objects typically start
with 'lhs'.
