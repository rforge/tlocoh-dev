\title{Class for location data}
\description{
Data class for locations with associated dates, nearest neighbor info, parameters for a random walk null model, and assorted meta-data
}
\details{
An object of class \code{locoh.lxy} is a list containing a series of point locations and ancillary
variables that go with those locations (e.g., time stamps, point IDs, animal IDs). These items
are bundled together and 'ready to go' as inputs into T-LoCoH functions. The benefits of bundling all
of the objects related to a set of point locations in a single list object includes:

\itemize{
    \item cleaning and error checking only has to be done once when the lxy object is created (e.g., with \code{\link{xyt.lxy}})
    \item having all of the ancillary variables together simplifies the task of passing parameters to other functions as well as saving/retrieving your work to disk
    \item the nearest neighbor lookup-table (which can take a long time to compute) can be reused
    \item locations for multiple individuals can be saved in one object
    }

In code examples, objects of class \code{locoh.lxy} are often indicated by a 'lxy' suffix, and functions that are designed to work on LoCoH-xy
objects typically start with 'lxy'.
